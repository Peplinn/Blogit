This app was made following the Tutorial by Corey Schafer on Youtube. It is a simple app that demonstrates basic Django functionality.
It currently includes authentication pages, a profile page and the home page where blog posts can be viewed.
The frontend has been styled with Bootstrap CSS which enabled focus on the backend.
Modifications will be made to the app structure and choice features introduced soon.
